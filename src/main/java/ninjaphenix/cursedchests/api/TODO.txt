real todo:
  Towelette support (when their api is released)
  Stair chests (should these be full blocks like old chests or indented like new blocks)
  Make the api a proper api, perhaps have an entry point that gives the API instance.

possible todo:
  Maybe add custom open stat for each chest type
  Curse of binding to lock a chest to a specific player (make upgrade ?)
  Trapped chest variant (make upgrade ?)
  Ender chest variant (maybe too far out of scope)



current todo:
  find common elements in FullChestBlock and CursedChestBlock and make a base class.
  And the block entity
